## Overview

The challenge is to build out a responsive product component and get it looking as close to the design as possible by using any tools I'd like to help me complete the challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

Initially I attempted this challenge using Flexbox however, this was problematic when it came to the responsive design. This could potentially be due to lack of experience and knowing when Flexbox is applicable for certain situations. Due to time restraints I decided to look at different tools to accomplish the challenge and decided to learn CSS Grid to see if achieving the desired result was faster and more controllable.

Using a combination of Grid for the main layout and Flexbox for the internal elements allowed me to complete the challenge to a high degree of accuracy.

During my reasearch I also stumbled accross using CSS Variables as well as BEM, the Block, Element, Modifier methodology which has also been incorporated into the project workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Using the BEM methodoligy for more precise class assignments relating to a single element. CSS variables to facilitate sweeping changes in design and the basics of Grid to build better and more controllable layouts for the web.

### Continued development

I will continue to build more components and web pages using a combination for Grid and Flexbox to further expand on my knowledge enabling me to determine what tool is best for particular jobs.
